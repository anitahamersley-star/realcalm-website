        <p class="text">
          Real Calm is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information in line with the Psychology Board of Australia Code of Conduct, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), and mandatory reporting laws.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Real Calm is a neurodiversity-affirming, trauma-informed private psychology practice based in Western Australia. We provide assessment, therapy and support for children, adolescents and adults.<br><br>
          Because we work with sensitive health information, we take your privacy and confidentiality very seriously.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">2. What Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="text">We collect information that is reasonably necessary to provide psychological services, including:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li><strong>Personal details</strong> – name, date of birth, contact details, gender, pronouns and emergency contact</li>
          <li><strong>Funding and billing details</strong> – Medicare number, Mental Health Treatment Plan details, NDIS information, private health insurance details, invoicing details</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical information</strong> – referral information, psychosocial and developmental history, family history, assessment results, diagnoses, treatment plans and clinical notes</li>
          <li><strong>Correspondence</strong> – letters and reports from GPs, psychiatrists, allied health providers, schools and support coordinators</li>
          <li><strong>Payment information</strong> – limited payment details such as payment method and transaction records. Full card details are not stored by Real Calm and are handled securely by our payment providers (Stripe and Tyro)</li>
          <li><strong>Website and booking data</strong> – information collected when you submit forms or use our online booking system (for example, IP address, browser type, date and time of access)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">We only collect information that is relevant to your care, safety, and the operation of the practice.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">3. Why We Collect Your Information</h2>
        <p class="text">We collect your personal and health information so that we can:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>Provide psychological assessment, therapy and related services</li>
          <li>Understand your background, needs, goals and preferences</li>
          <li>Communicate with you about appointments, reports and recommendations</li>
          <li>Coordinate care with other providers (for example, your GP, school, support coordinator or other therapists)</li>
          <li>Manage billing and claims with Medicare, NDIS and private health funds</li>
          <li>Maintain accurate clinical records and meet legal, ethical and professional obligations</li>
          <li>Improve the quality and safety of the services we provide</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">We will not use your information for purposes unrelated to your care without your consent, unless required or authorized by law.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">4. How Your Information Is Stored</h2>
        <p class="text">Your information is stored in secure electronic systems and, where necessary, limited paper records. We use safeguards to protect your information, including:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>Password-protected, encrypted practice management software</li>
          <li>Role-based access so only authorized staff can view your records</li>
          <li>Secure telehealth platforms</li>
          <li>Secure document storage and backup procedures</li>
          <li>Tokenized credit card storage via Stripe or Tyro (we cannot see or retrieve your full card details)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">We keep your records for the minimum period required by Australian law and professional guidelines (typically seven years after your last contact, or until age 25 for children and adolescents), after which they are securely destroyed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">5. Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p class="text">
          We respect your confidentiality. We will not share your information with third parties unless you have given your informed consent; it is necessary to coordinate your care; or it is required or authorized by law.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Examples of when we may disclose information include:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>To your GP, psychiatrist, paediatrician, other allied health providers or school staff involved in your care</li>
          <li>To NDIS, Medicare or your private health fund for billing and claims purposes</li>
          <li>To a parent or legal guardian, where clinically appropriate and legally required</li>
          <li>When there is a serious or imminent risk of harm to you or someone else and sharing information is needed to reduce that risk</li>
          <li>When a child is at risk of harm and we are required to notify appropriate agencies under mandatory reporting laws</li>
          <li>When disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious crime</li>
          <li>When we are required to respond to a court order, subpoena or other legal process</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">Where possible, we will discuss any proposed disclosure with you and seek your consent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">6. Telehealth and Electronic Communication</h2>
        <p class="text">
          We offer services via secure telehealth platforms (video and/or telephone). While we use reputable, encrypted platforms, no online service can be guaranteed 100% risk-free.
        </p>
        <p class="text">By using telehealth, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>You will take reasonable steps to protect your own privacy (e.g. using a private space, secure device and internet connection)</li>
          <li>There may be minimal residual risks associated with digital communication (for example, platform outages or unauthorized access despite precautions)</li>
          <li>You can request adjustments to camera use, pacing, or sensory needs at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">We will not record sessions without your explicit consent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">7. Use of Digital Tools and AI</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Real Calm may use secure digital or AI-assisted tools to support administrative tasks and clinical documentation, such as drafting letters, summarizing information, or creating resources. These tools do not replace professional judgement.
        </p>
        <p class="text">When using digital tools, we:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>minimize identifying information</li>
          <li>avoid uploading full clinical notes or sensitive personal details</li>
          <li>comply with privacy laws, code of conduct and ethical guidelines</li>
          <li>tell you if AI-supported tools are used in any way that relates to your care</li>
          <li>respect your choice if you prefer that we do not use these tools</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">Your privacy and safety remain our priority.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">8. Data Breaches</h2>
        <p class="text">If personal information is lost or accessed by unauthorized persons, we will:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>take immediate steps to contain the breach</li>
          <li>assess the level of risk</li>
          <li>notify affected individuals if required</li>
          <li>comply with the Notifiable Data Breach Scheme under the Privacy Act</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="stack">
        <h2 class="h2">9. Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h2>
        <p class="text">You have the right to:</p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>Request access to your personal information</li>
          <li>Ask us to correct information that is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
          To do this, please contact us in writing (see details below). We will respond within a reasonable time and discuss the best way to provide access. In some circumstances, we may be required to retain certain information or may not be able to grant access (for example, if it would pose a serious threat to someone’s safety). If this occurs, we will explain why.
        </p>
